    <section>
      <title>Motivation</title>

      <para>Arithmetic operations in C++ are NOT guaranteed to yield a correct
        mathematical result. For instance, the overflow on addition operation
        may produce an infinite value. Safe Float proposes implementing a
        drop-in replacement for floating point numeric data types guaranteeing
        that, when used in expressions in a C++ program, no unexpected arithmetic
        results will be produced silently without the developer awareness.
      </para>

      <para>An example of the problem:</para>

      <programlisting>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;limits&gt;

int main(){
    using namespace std;
    float a = numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::max();
    float b = a + numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::max();
    cout &lt;&lt; "b is " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; endl;
    
    return 0;
}
      </programlisting>

      <para>Executing this code outputs:</para>

      <programlisting>b is inf</programlisting>

      <para>This is a convenient fallback for the overflow in some contexts,
        but an unexpected silent surprise in others. Overflow to infinite is not
        the only surprise silently introduced by floating point operations,
        neither the most dangerous. it is actually the one most programmers care
        to check.
      </para>

      <para>In 1991, David Goldberg collected a list of the most common
        dangers when developing using Floating Point, which can be found on his
        paper: "What every computer scientist should know about floating-point
        arithmetic".
      </para>

      <para>Most important dangers can be classified as follows:</para>

      <para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Rounding error</para>

            <para>Some operations may require rounding the result. (i.e.
              because the mantissa is not large enough to keep the
              result.)
            </para>

            <para>Definition error. (i.e. 0.3 is not expressible as Floating
              Point.)
            </para>

            <para>An interesting side-effect of rounding is that operations
              are not guaranteed to be reversible: a != a+b-b is a valid
              result.
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Not a Number</para>

            <para>Some operations may produce Not a Number results, and they
              are not detected until used (if signalling is on).
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Infinity by overflow</para>

            <para>Infinity arithmetic is useful mostly when infinity values
              are defined by user, and not because of an overflow.
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Signed zero</para>

            <para>In some cases as discontinuous functions the negative zero
              have important use.
            </para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Underflow (considering and not considering normalised
              numbers as underflow)
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>A real world example of the issue is the use of Floating Point in
        Discrete Event System Specification simulation to define the temporal
        position of the events in a Real timeline. In this context, developers
        intensively use Floating Point and they usually give a special meaning
        to the infinite values called Passive state in the literature. In their
        context, an infinite obtained as overflow operating with finite numbers
        produces incorrect simulation result, because it silently changes the
        state to passive when it should not.
      </para>

      <para>In C++11 standard cfenv.h was introduced facilitating the access
        to the Floating Point Unit flags for controlling and checking
        information related to Floating Point operations. This allows us to have
        a higher level of control than the one we had on traditional C++.
      </para>

      <para>Anyway, developer intervention is required for checking every
        Floating Point operation was conducted as expected. Doing so, renders
        the code harder to read, maintain and it adds a new source of potential
        programming errors.
      </para>

      <para>Safe_float proposes the introduction of a class template wrapping
        Floating Point data types introducing safety checks for arithmetic
        operations. In the case an operation result is unreliable it reports the
        user properly.
      </para>

      <para>Depending on the algorithms implemented, different safety measures
        may be required, in our previously described example with the use of
        infinities for Discrete Event Simulation, the algorithms are not
        sensitive to rounding and this should not be treated as a safety
        problem, neither have a performance penalty based the unused
        check.
      </para>

      <para>Since, the reliability of the results is based on the algorithms
        used, we propose letting developers declare their concerns using
        template parameters as policies.
      </para>

      <para>We try to provide policies for most of the dangers before mentioned. However,
        some of the checks may be missing. To see the full list of the checks implemented by
        safe_float please check the Policies section of the documentation.
      </para>

      <para>We show some usage examples below for illustration.</para>

      <programlisting>//no underflow example

safe_float&lt;double, check_overflow, on_fail_throw&gt; a = 1;

safe_float&lt;double, check_overflow, on_fail_throw&gt; b = numeric_limits&lt;double&gt;::max();

safe_float&lt;double, check_overflow, on_fail_throw&gt; c = a / b ; //throws because of underflow.

//no rounding example

safe_float&lt;double, check_inexact_rounding, abort_on_fail&gt; d = 0.3_sd; // compilation error, the number is not
representable.

safe_float&lt;double, check_inexact_rounding, abort_on_fail&gt; e = 2E25;

safe_float&lt;double, check_inexact_rounding, abort_on_fail&gt; f = 2E100;

safe_float&lt;double, check_inexact_rounding, abort_on_fail&gt; g = e + f ; //aborts execution with runtime error.

    <title>Tutorial</title>

    <para>In introduction, we showed an example of how overflow of adding two
      non-infinite float variables produce an infinite result. We reproduce the
      same example here for reference.
    </para>

    <programlisting>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;limits&gt;

int main(){
    using namespace std;
    float a = numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::max();
    float b = a + numeric_limits&lt;float&gt;::max();
    cout &lt;&lt; "b is " &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; endl; //outputs: b is inf
    
    return 0;
}
    </programlisting>

    <para>If we replace the type used by both variables to
      safe_float&lt;float, check_addition_overflow&gt;, the addition would have
      thrown an exception to inform the user.
    </para>

    <programlisting>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;limits&gt;
#include &lt;boost/safe_float.hpp&gt;

int main(){
    using namespace std;
    using namespace boost::safe_float;
    try {
        using sf_without_overflow = safe_float&lt;float,policy::check_addition_overflow&gt;;
        sf_without_overflow a = numeric_limits&lt;sf_without_overflow &gt;::max();
        sf_without_overflow b = a + a;
    } catch ( const boost::safe_float_exception&amp; e) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "safe_float required guarantees broken" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
    </programlisting>

    <para>Here the addition throws an exception informing the user that one of
      the requirements was not covered by the operation result. It is important
      to notice safe_float does nothing to fix this, the task of the library is
      detect and inform only, user needs to handle the detected problems.
    </para>

    <para>The minimal granularity of a checking policies is checking one
      operation for a single concern. They can be composed for providing more
      complex checks and affect more operations. The library includes several
      common use compositions under the convenience.hpp file and it is easy to
      introduce new checks for particular purposes if needed. The complete list
      of policies can be found in the Policies section of the documentation.
      The list of policies do not restrict to only flags in the FENV being checked,
      but also include policies to define how to safe_float plays along with other datatypes.
      For example, policy::allow_cast_to&lt;T&gt; defines if a cast to T is allowed or not.
    </para>

    <para>The following is an example allowing to cast from integer to safe_float
      and checking for overflow in additions.
    </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;limits&gt;
#include &lt;boost/safe_float.hpp&gt;

int main(){
    using namespace std;
    using namespace boost::safe_float;
    using sf = safe_float&lt;float,
        policy::check_overflow,
        policy::on_fail_throw,
        policy::allow_cast_from&lt;int&gt;
    &gt;;
    int i = 1;
    double d = 2.0;
    sf a{i}; //works
    sf b{d}; //fails compilation
    
    return 0;
}
      </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>In some contexts, as real-time critical systems, the use of
      exceptions is restricted or fully deactivated. For this contexts, it is
      useful to specify other error handling methods to be used. For a full list
      of reported methods and how to define a custom one, please check the Concept
      reporter documentation.
    </para>

    <para>The following is a example of how to use the library for asserting
      in place of throwing.
      <programlisting>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;limits&gt;
#include &lt;boost/safe_float.hpp&gt;

int main(){
    using namespace std;
    using namespace boost::safe_float;
    using sf_asserting_overflows=safe_float&lt;float,policy::check_overflow, policy::on_fail_assert&gt;;
    sf_asserting_overflows a = numeric_limits&lt;sf_asserting_overflows&gt;::max();
    sf_asserting_overflows b = a + a;
    
    return 0;
}
      </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>Here, assert will be used in place of throw aborting execution and
      informing in debug mode, but having no impact at all in the release mode.
      Other alternative reporters provided include on_fail_abort, on_fail_throw,
      on_fail_unexpected, and on_fail_log.

        <para>For combining the Policies a composer function is used called
          policy::compose_check, the function receives variadic template list of policies

template&lt;typename FP&gt;
using new_policy = policy::compose_check&lt;FP, policy::check_overflow, /* arbitrary checks */&gt;;

            templates.
          </para>
        </question>

        <answer>
          <para>Policies can be complex and reusable. We want to allow users to define
            them using the using keyword for that purpose. Composer allows easily to do that.

              FPEs?
            </para>
          </question>

          <answer>
            <para>In general, the main differences are Flexibility, customization of reporting, and
              multiplatform/compiler.
            </para>
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>Flexibility: Safefloat adds more granular control than FPE. FPE affects every variable in the
                system the same, while safefloat can be used to enforce some checks for a subgroup of all the floating
                point variables in the program or library, and even set different checks for different variables.
              </listitem>
              <listitem>Customization of reporting: Safefloat provides more options on how to react to failure. FPE will
                abort, while safefloat library provides different strategies to act when a check fails, it may be the
                case that you can expect a check to fail under certain conditions (exceptional behavior). An alternative
                would be to manually check flags after each operation, in place of doing that, safe float could throw an
                exception that can be handled properly.
              </listitem>
              <listitem>Multiplatform/compiler: Safefloat is C++17 standard compliand and it should work in any compiler
                implementing that standard.
